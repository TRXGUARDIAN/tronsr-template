Initially we will run with the following specs:

Main Node: CPU 32/RAM 192/SSD 4 TB/Netwk 40/10 Gbps/Trans 20 TB

Backup:  CPU 16/RAM 192/SSD 1280 GB/Netwk 40/4 Gbps/Trans 20 TB

Solidity Node: CPU 8/RAM 32/SSD 640 TB/Netwk 40/12 Gbps/Trans 16 TB

During the first month of being a TRON SR, We will upgrade and comply with the TRON recommendations for the main server, over time weâ€™ll add nodes ensuring the stability of the network.  We will have failover and Anti-DDoS, as well as building cluster guardian nodes to protect the witness.
