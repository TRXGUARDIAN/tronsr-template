INTRO

TRX Guardian is a community SR Candidate to help support and drive the growth of the TRON community and ecosystem.  The community should always have a voice on what the future of TRON holds and our goal is to make sure that happens.  Our focus and plans will always be driven by the community, together we will decide the path forward; Your vision, our responsibility. 

SRs are responsible not only for protecting, but maintaining, building and supporting the network.  Our vision is to vigorously build a bigger and stronger ecosystem together, with the community and other SRs.

We believe that the community SR’s will have TRON and the community’s best interest ahead of everything else and we would be honored to be one of your 27 SRs.
